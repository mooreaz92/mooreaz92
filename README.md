*Analyzing banking marketing data to optimize customer acquisition strategies*

In this project, I embarked on my capstone journey at Flatiron School. Leveraging my data science toolkit, I analyzed extensive banking marketing data to identify the leading causes of customer acquisitions. Using machine learning techniques, I developed a customer acquisition predictor, enabling targeted marketing efforts. To make the insights accessible to non-technical stakeholders, I also created a user-friendly no-code application using Streamlit.
