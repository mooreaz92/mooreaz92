# Ryan Moore

## CPA | Aspiring Data Analyst | Music Enthusiast

Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Ryan Moore, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and aspiring data analyst based in the vibrant city of Chicago. I have a passion for leveraging data to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions. When I'm not crunching numbers or coding, you'll find me playing in local bands around Chicago

### Education

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Finance from Boston College in 2014 and graduated from the Flatiron Data Science program in April of 2023. During my time at Boston College, I was actively involved in the music scene. As a member of the drumline for all four years, I had the opportunity to explore my musical talents and contribute to the college's vibrant music community. I held the position of section leader for two years, honing my leadership skills and fostering a collaborative environment within the drumline.

### Data Science Journey

After eight year in public accounting and a short stint as a financial reporting manager, I was motivated by my passion for data analysis and the desire to leverage technology for meaningful insights and I pursued the data science program at Flatiron School. This immersive experience provided me with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, machine learning, and natural language processing that I am excited to use out in the working world. 

### Pinned Projects

#### [Bank Campaign Optimizer](https://github.com/mooreaz92/bank_campaign_optimizer)
*Analyzing banking marketing data to optimize customer acquisition strategies*

In this project, I embarked on my capstone journey at Flatiron School. Leveraging my data science toolkit, I analyzed extensive banking marketing data to identify the leading causes of customer acquisitions. Using machine learning techniques, I developed a customer acquisition predictor, enabling targeted marketing efforts. To make the insights accessible to non-technical stakeholders, I also created a user-friendly no-code application using Streamlit.

#### [Music Festival Visualization](https://github.com/mooreaz92/music_festival_viz_practice)
*Visualizing 9 years of music festival data in Europe using Python, Google Maps API, and Tableau*

Combining my passion for music and data, I embarked on this exciting project. By leveraging Python and the Google Maps API, I scraped and collected data from nine years of music festivals in Europe. I then utilized Tableau to create captivating visualizations, uncovering trends and patterns in the festival landscape. From attendance figures to geographical distribution, this project showcases the power of data visualization in the music industry.

### Additional Projects

In addition to my pinned projects, I have worked on various other data-driven endeavors. Here are a few highlights:

- **NLP Analysis:** Explored the realm of natural language processing by analyzing sentiment and performing topic modeling on a corpus of customer reviews, providing valuable insights for business improvement.

- **Statistical Root Cause Analysis:** Conducted a detailed statistical analysis to identify root causes of production issues in a manufacturing plant, assisting in process optimization and quality enhancement.
